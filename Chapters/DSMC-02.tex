To include the effects of Majorana spin flips in our DSMC simulations we will obviously have to develop some semiclassical method \ie simulate the positions of the atoms classically using the DSMC method and simulate the internal state of the atom with a quantum mechanical approach.
One such approach would be to use the Ehrenfest theorem \cite{Ehrenfest1927} to calculate the average force applied to an atom based on its current internal state (I have given a brief pseudo-code in listing \ref{lst:Ehrenfest}).
Using this method we would evolve the internal state of the atom using the Schr\"odinger equation then, using the internal state of the atom, we can calculate the expectation value of the force to use in evolving the position of the atom.

Unfortunately this technique is not a viable solution, as we will demonstrate in this chapter.
While we are able to capture some of the interesting physics (usually short term) of the Majorana spin flip using the Ehrenfest approach, it just fails over long simulation periods.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Simulating Schr\"odinger Equation}

To make use of the proposed Ehrenfest method (EM) we need to be able to accurate solve the Sch\"odinger equation.
Some of the more straight forward approached might be to apply a finite difference technique directly to the pde, however these methods are not generally conservative \cite{?}.
In fact the techniques that are considered more stable generally have some non-physical numerical dissipation as a results of the approximations made \cite{?} (or even show?).

The approach we have employed here, and in chapter \ref{ch:dsmcmcwf}, is to make use of the unitary time evolution operator \cite{?}.
The main benefit of this approach is, as the name suggests, the operator is unitary and hence inherently conserves probability.
The unitary time evolution operator is defined as follows
\begin{equation}
    \widehat{U}(t_0,t_0+\Delta t) = \exp\left[-\frac{\imath}{\hbar}\int_{t_0}^{t_0+\Delta t} \widehat{H}(t)\,dt \right]. \label{eq:timeEvolution}
\end{equation}
That is for a time dependant Hamiltonian we can evolve the state of our wavefunction, $\vert \psi \rangle$, through a moment of time $\Delta t$, through the application of the time evolution operator, $\widehat{U}$,
\begin{equation*}
    \ket{ \psi (t_0+\Delta t) } = \widehat{U}(t_0,t_0+\Delta t) \ket{ \psi (t_0) }.
\end{equation*}
This method is especially useful for our two level system as we can explicitly derive an expression for the $2\times2$ matrix form of $\widehat{U}$.
Recall from section \ref{sec:intromag} that the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \widehat{H} = -\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}} \cdot \mathbf{B},
\end{equation*}
which can be expressed in matrix form as
\begin{equation*}
    \widehat{H} = \frac{1}{2}g_s\mu_B \begin{bmatrix} B_z & B_x - \imath B_y \\
                                                      B_x + \imath B_y & -B_z \end{bmatrix}.                                          
\end{equation*}
In general the magnetic field components are functions of position, which, for the atoms is a function of time.
For a general magnetic field we do not know explicitly what the time dependance will be and so we will not be able to explicitly integrate the Hamiltonian as required by equation \eqref{eq:timeEvolution}.
\marginpar{Make a side note about higher order integration.}
So we will have to make the assumption that our time steps are very small, $\Delta t \ll 1$, so that over the time step the Hamiltonian remains relatively constant.
In this limit we have, $\int\widehat{H}\,dt = \widehat{H}\Delta t$, so that the time evolution operator becomes
\begin{align}
    \widehat{U}(t_0,t_0+\Delta t) &= \exp\left[  -\imath\frac{g_s\mu_B\Delta t}{2 \hbar} \begin{bmatrix} B_z & B_x - \imath B_y \\
                                                      B_x + \imath B_y & -B_z \end{bmatrix} \right],\\
                &= \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - \imath n_z \sin\theta & -\left(n_y+\imath n_x\right)\sin\theta \\
                                   \left(n_y-\imath n_x\right)\sin\theta & \cos\theta + \imath n_z \sin\theta\end{bmatrix}, 
\end{align}
where $\theta = g_s \mu_B \Delta t \vert \mathbf{B} \vert / 2\hbar$ and $n_k = B_k / \vert \mathbf{B} \vert$ are the directional components of the magnetic field normal vector.
This simple closed form expression makes it very easy to implement the unitary evolution operator method numerically.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Schr\"odinger Simulations}

To test out this technique lets just numerically solve the original Majorana problem \eqref{eq:Majprob}.
In figure \ref{fig:majprob} I have simulated two scenarios: a spin flip (figs \ref{fig:labframeFlip}, \ref{fig:rotframeFlip}) and a not flip (figs \ref{fig:labframeNoFlip}, \ref{fig:rotframeNoFlip}).
Each scenario is plotted in two seperate refernce frames: the laboratory frame and the co-rotating frame.
The laboratory frame is the frame in which the spin up direction is aligned with the $z$-axis, the co-rotating frame is the frame in which the spin up direction is aligned with the magnetic field.
\marginpar{We find the spin up and spin down components in the co-rotating frame by projecting onto the "local" magnetic field. We do this using the projection operator, $ \ket{\phi_{\uparrow,\downarrow}} = \widehat{P}_{\uparrow,\downarrow} \ket{\Psi}$, where the projection operator is given by $\widehat{P} = ??$.}
The laboratory frame is the frame in which the differential equation is set, however in this frame it can become a little confusing about wether a particular spin state is flipped our not.
In both of the simulations the direction of the magnetic field changes at $t=0$, so the orientation of the spin up direction in the lab frame also changes.
In the co-rotating frame it is always clear which state is the spin up state.

}
\caption{Simulating the no majorana spin flip }\label{fig:majprob}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:labframeFlip} and \ref{fig:rotframeFlip} both illustrate a Majorana spin flip.
In this simulation we used the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}=(0.1,0.0,2500t)\,\mathrm{mT}$, and began at $t=-15\,\mathrm{ms}$ where the population in the spin component in the lab frame is less than $10^6$ (although we have plotted a smaller time window in figure \ref{fig:majprob}).
We can see the distinct different between the behaviour of the spin populations in the two different reference frames.
The initial wavefunction was chosen such that the population of the spin up component in the lab frame was 1.
Figure \ref{fig:rotframeFlip} clearly displays a change in the most probable state, whereas in figure \ref{fig:labframeFlip} it is not so clear.
Again this is because in the lab frame the spin up direction changes at $t=0$ when the sign of the $z$ component of the magnetic field moves from negative to positive.
Figures \ref{fig:labframeNoFlip} and \ref{fig:rotframeNoFlip} results from a simulation with $\mathbf{B}=(0.2,0.0,2500t)\,\mathrm{mT}$.
In these plots we see the converse behaviour in the state populations, indicating that no spin flip has occurred.

For both simulations we have used a time step of $\Delta t = 1\,\mu\mathrm{s}$.
This may seem overkill given the rate of change of the magnetic field can be characterised by $\tau_B=\vert\mathbf{B}\vert / \partial_t\vert\mathbf{B}\vert = 15\,\mathrm{ms}$ at the beginning of the simulation.
However there is another time scale that must be considered in a simulation like this, that is the period of a Larmor precession, $T_L = 2\pi\hbar / g_s \mu_B \vert\mathbf{B}\vert = 3.81\,\mu\mathrm{s}$ at the begining of the simulation.
While we do not expect the spin to precess for the first half of the simulation when it is completely aligned with the magnetic field, it is the period close to the field minimum and beyond that will experience Larmor precession.
In fact the wiggles after the spin flip occur at the Larmor precision frequency.
For example, look at one period of oscillation around $t=0.3\,\mathrm{ms}$, here the Larmor precession period will be, $T_L=0.19\,\mathrm{ms}$, exactly as simulated (**MAKE INSET IN FIGURE TO SHOW LARMOR PRECESSION RATE**).

\marginpar{The astute reader may be confused by line 4 of the pseudo-code in listing \ref{lst:Ehrenfest}.
The appearance of the $n+1^\mathrm{th}$ velocity when calculating the $n+1^\mathrm{th}$ position is not how one might implement the standard Euler integration method. 
Here we have used an implementation of the Symplectic Euler method \cite{??}, which has better energy conserving properties than the standard forward Euler.
This technique still has the same order accuracy with time, and introduces no added computational complexity, yet we gain some extra stability in the total energy of the atom.}

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Single Atom Spin Flips} \label{sec:EhrenfestSingleAtom}

Confident in our ability to accurately simulate the Schr\"odinger equation, in our regime of interest, we may begin to apply the Ehrenfest method to simulating spin flips of real atoms.
The first step is to first see wether or not we can simulate the spin flip of a single atom.
I have given a pseudo-code example for a single time step of the Ehrenfest algorithm in listing \ref{lst:Ehrenfest}\footnote{Note in listing \ref{lst:Ehrenfest} that we have denoted the discrete approximation to a continuous variable as, $g_n \approx g(t_n)$.}.
\begin{lstlisting}[float,caption=Psuedo-code algorithm for a single Ehrenfest method time step, mathescape,label= lst:Ehrenfest,stepnumber=1]
Calculate force using current spin state: $\mathbf{F}_n = \bra{\Psi_n}\widehat{\mathbf{F}}_n\ket{\Psi_n}$.
Evolve wavefunction using time evolution operator: $\ket{\Psi_{n+1}} = \widehat{U}_n \ket{\Psi_{n}}$.
Evolve velocity using the average force: $\mathbf{v}_{n+1} = \mathbf{v}_n + \mathbf{F}_n \Delta t / m$.
Evolve position using the new velocity: $\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \mathbf{x}_n + \mathbf{v}_{n+1} \Delta t$.
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}

\caption{No flip and flip in the same simulation.}\label{fig:ehrenfestFlip}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ehrenfestFlip} shows the results from one such simulation.
This simulation was of a rubidium 87 atom the began at $z=-5\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ with a zero initial velocity.
Again the initial wavefunction was chosen so that it would be completely spin up in the co-rotating frame.
The magnetic field was given by $\mathbf{B} = (B_x,0,B_z'z)$, with $B_x=1\,\mu\mathrm{T}$ and $B_z'=2.5\,\mathrm{Tm}^{-1}$\footnote{I am aware that this magnetic field does not satisfy Maxwell's equations, but it serves as a nice example and more closely aligns with the field considered by Majorana.}.
This is a fabulous example of how well the Ehrenfest method can work.
Figure \ref{fig:ehrenfestSpin} displays how well the spin populations are simulated.
Again they agree with the predictions of the Majorana formula and the total probability is conserved.
\marginpar{Say how I can still use the Majorana formula here. $c =v(t=0) B_z'$.}
In figure \ref{fig:ehrenfestPos} I have plotted the position and velocity of the atom as it moves through time.
We can see how the atom remains trapped after the first partial flip and is then completely ejected from the trapped once it has flipped.
Finally figure \ref{fig:ehrenfestEnergy} shows how the total energy of the atom is conserved throughout the simulation (even after is has flipped).
So things seem to be working quite well, but earlier I alluded to the fact that the Ehrenfest method is not suitable to this kind of problem, so what is wrong?
I will let you stew on this few a few sections while we investigate the behaviour of a full gas simulation.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Full Gas Simulations}

Convinced that our Ehrenfest method can simulate spin flips and conserves both energy and probability we can begin to run some full gas simulations.
Majorana spin flips only occur when there is a sharp transition in magnetic field direction, like that transition that is present around the centre of a quadrupole trap.
An IP trap does not have this kind of transition, thus we would expect a very small number (~0) of spin flips to occur as a result of the IP field configuration.
As a cautionary test we will simulate a gas trapped in an IP trap using the Ehrenfest method.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Ioffe Pritchard Trap}

The IP trap will remove any of the complex dynamics (and atom loss) we would experience from Majorana loss.
This will allow us to simulate the energy and probability conserving characteristics of the method, as well as ensure that the simulated particle dynamics are as expected.

\begin{figure}

}
\caption{Ehrenfest method for a gas in an IP trap.}\label{fig:ehrenfestIP}
\end{figure}

The results from a simulation of $10^6$ rubidium 87 atoms at $2\,\mu\mathrm{K}$ in an IP with $B_0=0.01\,\mathrm{T}$, $B'=20.0\,\mathrm{Tm}^{-1}$ and $B''=40,000\,\mathrm{Tm}^{-2}$ over a period of approximately 10 collision times ($10\tau_c$) are shown in figure \ref{fig:ehrenfestIP}.
In this figure I have tried to show the conservative properties of the Ehrenfest method.
Figure \ref{fig:ehrenfestIPDist} illustrates the radial distribution of particles.
I have drawn the distribution at the beginning and the end of the simulation, as well as contrast it with the analytic result for a thermal gas.
\marginpar{The density distribution for a thermal gas is $n(\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \exp\left[-\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{r})/k_BT\right]$.}
As we can see the numerical result is very stable and agrees well with the analytic prediction.
In figure \ref{fig:ehrenfestIPCons} I have illustrated the change in the quantities we would expect to be conserved in a simulation like this.
The top graph shows the percentage change in the average total energy, the middle graph shows the percentage change in the average norm of the wavefunction and the bottom graph shows the number of atoms.

First of all we can note there is no change in the number of atoms \ie no Majorana spin flips.
This simulation has the same evaportaion code running as we developed in section \ref{sec:evaporation}, with the evaporation condition that if $P_z < 0$ the atom is removed.
This is due to the presence of the non-zero field bias, $B_0$, which ensures that the Larmor precession rate is always greater than the rate of change of the magnetic field direction.
Second we can see a linear increase in the total energy and wavefunction norm.
How can this be, I thought we were using fancy symplectic methods that were designed to conserve these quantities.
I have two responses to that question, the first is can we really call a \%0.005 (that is 1 in 20,000) increase a significant change?
For the simulation I have run here this corresponds to the total energy changing by $0.3\,\mathrm{nK}$, not we might consider a significant increase in temperature.
However, we can argue that there is a clear linear trend and if we anticipate running extended simulations this might be something that we wish to keep in mind.
Although I wouldn't consider this deal breaker.
My second response would be that the time step I have used is far too large.
For this simulation I have used the time step, $\Delta t = 5\,\mathrm{ns}$.
This might seem quite small but compared to the Larmor period at the the average radius, $T_L\approx 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{s}$, it isn't that great.
Not only does this mean on average we are only sampling the wavefunction twice per Larmor rotation, but out on the edges of the gas we are doing far worse!
Of course we could reduce the time step, and this would improve our energy conservation, but to be able to run these simulations in a reasonable time frame we must accept a certain level of non-conservation in our total energy and wavefunction norm.

Overall this seems to have worked quite well and yet I keep saying that the Ehrenfest method is not suitable for our simulations.
Let's now try to run a simulation in a quadrupole trap and see how effective the method is.
