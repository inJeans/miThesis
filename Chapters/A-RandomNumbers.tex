\chapter{Random Numbers} \label{app:randomNumbers}

What is a random number?\\
Psuedo random numbers.\\

\section{Pseudo Random Numbers} \label{app:pseudoRand}

pseudorandom numbers - \emph{numbers with statistical properties of randomness.}

determinisitic - good because can debug simulations etc, bad because not true random number.\\
periodic - typical generators  used today have period far larger than would ever be exhausted.\\
efficient - good for simulation because we can get many numbers in a short amount of time.

- Generating random numbers\\
- Generating random numbers in parallel

\section{Random Number Testing} \label{app:randTest}

- small crush, big crush etc.

\section{Examples, with code?}
